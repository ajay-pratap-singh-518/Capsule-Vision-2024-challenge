Train/
Contains the script train.py for training the model.

Test/
Contains the script test.py for testing and evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

Validtion/
Contains the script valid.py for validating the model during the training process.

**Setup Instructions**
To get started, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone 
cd Capsule-Vision-2024-Challenge
Install the required dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the training script: To train the model, execute:
python train/train.py
Run the validation script: For validation during training, use:
python valid/valid.py
Run the testing script: Once the model is trained, you can evaluate it using:
python valid/valid.py
